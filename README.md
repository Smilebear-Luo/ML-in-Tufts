This repository includes some codes and notes I wrote in Tufts machine learning classes(CS131, CS 135, CS136, CS137, MATH123, EE159). Most of them are wrote in Python, except few of them wrote in Matlab and R.

CS131: Artificial Intelligence(AI)
CS135: Introduction to Machine learning
CS136: Statistical Pattern Recognition
CS137: Deep learning
MATH123: Mathematical Aspects of Data Analysis
EE159: Convex Optimization
